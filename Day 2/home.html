            <b>The 2023 Ford Mustang remains a desirable coupe or
                convertible and a powerful symbol of American 4-wheeled culture.
                Pricing starts at $27,770.

                <p>Ford only makes one car, this one. Which says a lot about the
                enduring appeal of the Mustang even in an automotive world
                dominated
                by SUVs and trucks. There’s still demand for evocative coupes
                and
                convertibles, especially with V8 engines.</p>

                <p>We’re approaching the end of the Mustang’s sixth generation, but
                we’ve already seen the seventh. The all-electric Mustang Mach-E
                is
                not the same thing as the Mustang and has its own review.</p>

            <p>
                <p>Although it’s a particularly American thing to have a Mustang
                with a V8, we still have a lot of affection for the turbocharged
                4-cylinder engine in the lower trims. It means less weight in
                the nose for one thing. Which is a positive, since the Mustang
                feels quite heavy, and a lighter front end means the steering is
                nice and responsive.</p>

                <p>It’s certainly not as chuckable as something as small and light
                as a Mazda MX-5 Miata, of course, but it’s still enjoyable, even
                more so with the High Performance Pack (HPP) boosting horsepower
                from 310 to 332. There’s a perceptible difference — more
                liveliness. Even the base Mustang handles really well, though.
                We’ve all encountered those Mustang GT drivers who put their car
                into Sport driving mode and then go barking up the freeway.
                Maybe we should savor those unmistakable V8 sounds before
                everything goes electric.</p>

                <p>The Mach 1 is especially savory, with 470 horsepower boiling
                away under the hood. It also comes standard with an adaptive
                suspension that adjusts automatically and quickly to whatever
                demands the conditions of the moment are making.</p>
