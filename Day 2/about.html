            <font size="5"><b>High Performance Pack</b><br></font>
            Admittedly, it costs an extra $6,150, but this more powerful engine
            is also accompanied by a limited-slip differential, uprated
            suspension, stronger brakes, and plenty of other extras,
            <br><br>
            <font size="5"><b>10-speed automatic transmission</b><br></font>
            Although enthusiasts will love the standard manual transmission, the
            automatic option is an excellent unit that does a great job of
            keeping the engine in its sweet spot.
            <br><br>
            <font size="5"><b>SYNC 3</b><br></font>
            This is an upgraded infotainment system that comes in Premium
            versions of the EcoBoost and GT models. An 8-inch touchscreen,
            navigation, and Apple CarPlay/Android Auto phone integration are
            included.
            <br><br>
            <font size="5"><b>V8 engine</b><br></font>
            A special mix of muscle and music goes into a gasoline-fed V8
            engine. The GT and Mach 1 variants each have a 5.0-liter unit. It’s
            a classic.
            <br><br>
            <font size="5"><b>B&O audio</b><br></font>
            This system is one of Bang & Olufsen’s more cost-conscious
            offerings, but still sounds great. It’s a 12-speaker setup available
            only as an option in the range-topping Mach 1 Premium version.
            <br><br>
            <font size="5"><b>Hood stripes</b><br></font>
            It might be because we used to play with toy versions, but there’s
            something about a Mustang with stripes. In fact, a Mustang without
            them might even be seen as incomplete.

            <font size="5"><b>Engine & Transmission</b><br></font>
            A turbocharged 2.3-liter 4-cylinder engine is the inspiration behind
            the EcoBoost name of the most affordable 2023 Mustang variants. It
            makes 310 horsepower or 332 horses with the High Performance Pack.
            Either way, maximum torque is 350 lb-ft.
            <br><br>
            GT models employ a 5.0-liter V8 with a meaty 450 horsepower and 410
            lb-ft of torque. This same engine in the Mach 1 is boosted to 470
            horsepower, same torque.
            <br><br>
            All versions have rear-wheel drive and a 6-speed manual transmission
            as standard. A 10-speed automatic is optional. Regular gasoline
            works just fine.

            <font size="5"><b>3-year/36,000-Mile Warranty</b><br></font>
            Ford’s new-car warranty lasts for three years or 36,000 miles,
            whichever happens first. Plus a powertrain warranty of five years or
            60,000 miles. This is all fairly typical.
